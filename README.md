# Regional Data Analysis

This git repository contains a shell a project about using R for regional economic analysis.

Using mainly ONS region-by-industry GVA data, this project looks at wrangling data, making 
visualisations and other analysis tasks, and using libraries like tidyverse.


### Please also consider the following:
* Linting your code.  This is a formatting process that follows a rule set.  We broadly encourage the tidyverse standard, and recommend the `lintr` package.
* Comment your code to make sure others can follow.
* Consider your naming conventions: we recommend `snake case` where spaces are replaced by underscores and no capitals are use. E.g. `outpatient_referral_data`
