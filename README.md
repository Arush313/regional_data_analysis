# Sample project folder

This git repository contains a shell that should be used as the default structure for new projects.  
It won't fit all circumstances perfectly, and you can make changes and issue a 
pull request for new features / changes.

The aim of this template is two-fold: firstly to give a common structure for projects to aid
reproducibility, secondly to allow for additional security settings as default to prevent accidental upload of files that should not be committed to Git and GitHub.

__Please update/replace this README file with one relevant to your project__


### Please also consider the following:
* Linting your code.  This is a formatting process that follows a rule set.  We broadly encourage the tidyverse standard, and recommend the `lintr` package.
* Comment your code to make sure others can follow.
* Consider your naming conventions: we recommend `snake case` where spaces are replaced by underscores and no capitals are use. E.g. `outpatient_referral_data`
